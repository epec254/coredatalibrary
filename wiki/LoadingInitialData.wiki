#summary How to load initial data

= Introduction =

Follow these steps if your application needs to load initial data.


 # Build and run the application in the iPhone simulator and create any initial data.  If you have a lot of data or do not want to create it all through the GUI, create a method inside the app delegate similar to below that creates all the data you need.  This example is from the CoreData436 sample application.
  * It is recommended you delete the application from the simulator before starting this process to start with a "clean slate."
 {{{
- (void) createData
{
	WidgetType *type1 = (WidgetType *)[MANAGED_OBJECT_CONTEXT insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@"WidgetType"];
	type1.name = @"Type 1";
	type1.details = @"Some details blah blah";
	
	WidgetType *type2 = (WidgetType *)[MANAGED_OBJECT_CONTEXT insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@"WidgetType"];
	type2.name = @"Type 2";
	type2.details = @"Some details blah blah";
...
...
}
