#summary Getting started with CoreDataLibrary

= Introduction =

This guide walks you through the basic steps necessary to create an application with the CoreDataLibrary.  It assumes familiarity with Core Data, iPhone programming and XCode.

== Prerequisites == 

 * Ensure the CoreDataLibrary template is installed (see the [Installation installation guide]).
 * This is untested on anything lower than iPhone OS 3.1.3 and XCode 3.2.1

== Creating the project and updating the Core Data Model ==

 # Create a new XCode project using the `CoreDataLibrary Application` template.  We called our project `GettingStarted.`

 # By default, the template includes an entity named `Event` with two attributes, `name` and `timeStamp.`  The CDLRootViewController is configured to not have sections or section index titles.  If you make no changes to the project and run in the simulator, you will see a screen similar to below.

 # In this guide, we will add several attributes (a string called `detail` and a boolean called `publicEvent`and to-one relationship called `type`).  To begin, open the `GettingStarted.xcdatamodel` file under Resources.
 # You will be presented with the Core Data model editor.  Configure the model as shown below (click image for a bigger version)

 # Remove the `Event.h` and `Event.m` files from the project.
 # Select the `Event` and `EventType` entities in the Core Data model and select File -> *New File*.

 # From the New File dialog, select *Cocoa Touch Class* from beneath iPhone OS.  Then, select *Managed Object Class* from the list of choices.

 # Complete the New File wizard, accepting all defaults.  You will now have 4 new files, `Event.[m|h]` and `EventType.[m|h]`.

== Updating the DetailView property list ==

 # We will now update the DetailView to include the new attributes and relationship.  Open the `GettingStartedDetailView.plist` file.
  * We are going add the `publicEvent` and `type` properties to the existing section and create a new section for the `detail` property.
 # Create two new members of type Dictionary in the existing rowInformation array. Configure them as the screenshot below.  This is for the `publicEvent` and `type` properties.

 # Now, create a new Dictionary in the root array and configure it as the screenshot below.  This is for the `detail` property.

== Creating a custom row ==

 # We will now create a custom row to present a Delete button within the detail view (similar to the address book application).
 # Import the delete.png and delete_selected.png files into the project's resources folder.
 # Create a new subclass of NSObject, called `DeleteRowController.m`
 # Add the following code to the `DeleteRowController.h` file.  _NOTE: The requirement of a delegate property will be removed in a future version of the library._
{{{
#import "CDLTableRowController.h"

@interface DeleteRowController : NSObject <CDLTableRowControllerProtocol> {

}

/** Initialize the RowController with the given dictionary */
- (id) initForDictionary:(NSDictionary *) rowInformation;

/** Provide a UITableViewCell for this row. */
- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath;

/** Provide action if the UITableViewCell for this row is selected. */
- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath;

@end
