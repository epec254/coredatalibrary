#summary Getting started with CoreDataLibrary

= Introduction =

This guide walks you through the basic steps necessary to create an application with the CoreDataLibrary.  It assumes familiarity with Core Data, iPhone programming and XCode.

== Prerequisites == 

 * Ensure the CoreDataLibrary template is installed (see the [Installation installation guide]).
 * This is untested on anything lower than iPhone OS 3.1.3 and XCode 3.2.1

 # Create a new XCode project using the `CoreDataLibrary Application` template.  We called our project `GettingStarted.`

 # By default, the template includes an entity named `Event` with two attributes, `name` and `timeStamp.`  The CDLRootViewController is configured to not have sections or section index titles.  If you make no changes to the project and run in the simulator, you will see a screen similar to below.

 # In this guide, we will add several attributes (a string called `detail` and a boolean called `publicEvent`and to-one relationship called `type`).  To begin, open the `GettingStarted.xcdatamodel` file under Resources.
 # You will be presented with the Core Data model editor.  Configure the model as shown below (click image for a bigger version)
