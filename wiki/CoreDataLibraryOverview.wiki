#summary Overview of CoreDataUI

= Introduction =

CoreDataUI is an XCode template that helps you quickly create a tableview-based UI for a Core Data iPhone application.  Creating a UI consists of the following general steps:

  # Create a project using the XCode template
  # Create a CoreData model and the corresponding objects using XCode
  # Define the views through a set of Property List (plist) files.
  # Customize as needed.


= Implementation Details =

A *MORootViewController* displays all ManagedObjects of a given type.  Selecting a cell will load a MODetailViewController for that corresponding.

The MODetailViewController displays details about one ManagedObject.  Pressing Edit puts the table view into edit mode, allowing changes to the ManagedObject.
