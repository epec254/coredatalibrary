= Introduction =

CoreDataUI is an XCode template that helps you quickly create a tableview-based UI for a Core Data iPhone application.  Creating a UI consists of the following general steps:

  # Create a project using the XCode template
  # Create a CoreData model and the corresponding objects using XCode
  # Define the views through a set of Property List (plist) files.
  # Customize as needed.

The template will give you a customizable Plain-Style TableView that displays all entities of a given type.  Each row of this table, upon selection, will display a customizable Grouped-Style TableView for the object at the row. Upon selecting a row, you will be presented with a view that allows you to make changes to the value.

A *MORootViewController* displays all ManagedObjects of a given type.  Selecting a cell will load a MODetailViewController for that corresponding row.

The MODetailViewController displays details about one ManagedObject.  Pressing Edit puts the table view into edit mode, allowing changes to the ManagedObject.  Selecting a row in edit mode will present a MOFieldEditController for that row's attribute.
